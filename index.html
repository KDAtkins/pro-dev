				<h2>Weekly Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Week 0</h3>
				<p>This week was mostly review for me since I already have a background in some web design and coding.
					I look forward to exploring the areas of my weaknesses in professional/brand building and aspects/concepts
					of web design I haven't explored.</p>
				<h3>Week 1</h3>
				<p>I felt lecture started off as a drag this week because MySQL/Data Design has been the topic of discussion
					since last Thursday til Monday. Afterward, the rest of the week seems to pick up pace and we're finally going
					over OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and Front-End Design. OOP in PHP is slightly different from what I'm
					used to regarding to certain keywords used in other programming languages. I'm excited to see how we'll learn to
					make PHP collaborate with MySQL. That's an experience I haven't had before with web development. I'm really going
					to take full advantage of the Professional Development and what it has to offer.</p>
				<h3>Week 2</h3>
				<p>Lecture this week seemed moderate in all the topics/concepts covered. The TED talk given by Dylan on how
				to do an encrypted install of an OS via virtual machine was cool. I'm glad we finally decided on capstone
				 projects and were assigned teams. Looking forward to accomplishing and learning a lot with total strangers.</p>

				<h2>Team Reflection</h2>
				<p>The team exercise/game was interesting. I feel that it revealed our individual capacities in how we
				communicate and think. There were times during the game an individual would try to determine how another
				player would play before they had a chance to make an assessment on what to do next. I think that reveals a
				lack in receptiveness and confidence for those on your team. Experiencing this during the game affirmed that
				the individual likes to rush to a conclusion before others have a chance to deliberate on what action to take next.
				Regardless, we did beat the game at our first attempt.</p>
